# Parsing with Context Free Grammar-NLP-

In this assignment I implement the CKY algorithm for CFG and PCFG parsing.
I also practice retrieving parse trees from a parse chart and working with such
tree data structures.

I first conduct membership checking with CKY (Cocke¨CYounger¨CKasami algorithm) then I do parsing with backpointers.

Then I retrieve a parse tree from what I got above.

Finally, I evaluate the Parser
